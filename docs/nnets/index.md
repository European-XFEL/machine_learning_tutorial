# Neural networks

In this tutorial, we are going to implement a fully-connected feed-forward neural network from scratch. We will then use this neural network to classify the handwritten digits in [MNIST dataset](https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) [LeCun, Cortes, and Burges].

The following resources provide a nice basic introduction to neural networks:

We'll start by coding the neural network. Once done, we'll turn our attention to the MNIST dataset, in particular, we'll try to get familiar with it, plot a few of the digits, figure out how to transform the images into an input for our neural network, etc.
