# Linear Regression

Our first task, a warm-up if you will, is to build a linear regression model.
The model is given by
$$
y = f(x) = m\,x + b\,.
$$
This model has 2 ==parameters==, the slope $m$ and the offset $b$. Our task is to ==learn== these parameters in order to best describe a dataset.

This is an example of a ==supervised learning== task where we have a set inputs (features, $\mathbf{x}$) and a corresponding set of outputs (targets, $\mathbf{y}$).
